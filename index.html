    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        This study is designed to introduce chemistry students to the fundamentals of machine learning and deep learning, with a focus on their practical applications in chemical research. Beginning with core concepts such as supervised learning, neural networks, and optimization techniques, the course explores how data-driven approaches are transforming chemical discovery, molecular property prediction, and reaction modeling. It also covers recent advances in generative modeling, including diffusion models and flow matching, which are increasingly relevant in materials design and molecular generation. Hands-on programming sessions using PyTorch will help students build practical skills and gain intuition for how these models are implemented and used in real-world chemistry problems.
